INTRODUCTION       This glossary intends to provide a standard terminology for health care workers to communicate what is observed and what a patient reports during a seizure. As this terminology is descriptive and phenomenologic, its use would not imply or require knowledge of ictal pathophysiology, any pathological substrate, or etiology.       Many terms are adjectives modifying “seizure,” which itself is defined under “general terms.” This pertains to seizures with single or multiple components.       Terms in this glossary (e.g., “seizure,” “ictus,” which have widespread applicability in other fields of clinical neuroscience) are herein defined according to their references to epilepsy.       Some terms of this glossary are “fundamental” (i.e., they encompass other more precise words). These can be used as the sole descriptor when data to characterize a phenomenon more precisely are not available. Such include aura, automatism, experiential, motor, and sensory.       A seizure will often consist of two or more phenomena occurring simultaneously or sequentially and should be described accordingly.       Quantitative terms, such as duration of motor events, are not intended as immutable confines, but as clarifying guides to describe clinically observed events.       Scientific progress dictates an evolution of terms to retain their relevance. However, needs of communication in everyday life require that changes be gradual and evolutionary rather than abrupt and revolutionary. The use of synonyms in this glossary reflects incidents in which gradual changes are likely.       Terminology in some areas remains unresolved. Therefore we view this glossary as a dynamic process for which feedback will be welcomed.       PRINCIPLES FOR TERMS AND DEFINITIONS       In developing the “lexique” of this report, we adopted and applied the following principles.Terms and definitions should1. Contain features that distinguish or modify seizure entities. 2. Be descriptive of the phenomena involved. 3. Comply with terminology of clinical neuroscience. 4. Use current terminology and definitions wherever ?possible. 5. Contain new terms only if necessary. 6. Be easily translatable to other languages. 7. Be readily understood and used by potential users. ?
I GENERAL TERMS1.0 SEMIOLOGY?* That branch of linguistics concerned with signs and symptoms.2.0 EPILEPTIC SEIZURE?* Manifestation(s) of epileptic (excessive and/or hypersynchronous), usually self-limited activity of neurons in the brain.3.0 ICTUS?* A sudden neurologic occurrence such as a stroke or an epileptic seizure.4.0 EPILEPSY?a) Epileptic Disorder: A chronic neurologic condition characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures. b) Epilepsies: Those conditions involving chronic recurrent epileptic seizures that can be considered epileptic disorders.5.0 FOCAL?(syn. partial)* A seizure whose initial semiology indicates, or is consistent with, initial activation of only part of one cerebral hemisphere.6.0 GENERALIZED?(syn. bilateral)* A seizure whose initial semiology indicates, or is consistent with, more than minimal involvement of both cerebral hemispheres.7.0 CONVULSION?* Primarily a lay term. Episodes of excessive, abnormal muscle contractions, usually bilateral, which may be sustained or interrupted.II TERMS DESCRIBING EPILEPTIC SEIZURE SEMIOLOGYThese are descriptors of seizures unless specified otherwise.1.0 MOTOR?* Involves musculature in any form. The motor event could consist of an increase (positive) or decrease (negative) in muscle contraction to produce a movement. Unless noted, the following terms are adjectives modifying “motor seizure” or “seizure” (e.g., “tonic motor seizure or dystonic seizure”), and whose definitions can usually be understood as prefaced by “refers to . . .”1.1 ELEMENTARY MOTOR?* A single type of contraction of a muscle or group of muscles that is usually stereotyped and not decomposable into phases. (However, see tonic–clonic, an elementary motor sequence).1.1.1 TONIC?* A sustained increase in muscle contraction lasting a few seconds to minutes.1.1.1.1 EPILEPTIC SPASM (Formerly Infantile Spasm)* Noun: A sudden flexion, extension, or mixed extension–flexion of predominantly proximal and truncal muscles that is usually more sustained than a myoclonic movement but not so sustained as a tonic seizure (i.e., ?1 s). Limited forms may occur: grimacing, head nodding. Epileptic spasms frequently occur in clusters.1.1.1.2 POSTURAL* Adoption of a posture that may be bilaterally symmetric or asymmetric (as in a “fencing posture”).?1.1.1.2.1 VERSIVE?* A sustained, forced conjugate ocular, cephalic, and/or truncal rotation or lateral deviation from the midline.1.1.1.2.2 DYSTONIC?* Sustained contractions of both agonist and antagonist muscles producing athetoid or twisting movements, which, when prolonged, may produce abnormal postures.1.1.2  MYOCLONIC (adjective); MYOCLONUS (noun)* Sudden, brief (<100 ms) involuntary single or multiple contraction(s) of muscles(s) or muscle groups of variable topography (axial, proximal limb, distal).1.1.2.1 NEGATIVE MYOCLONIC * Interruption of tonic muscular activity for <500 ms without evidence of preceding myoclonia.1.1.2.2 CLONIC?* Myoclonus that is regularly repetitive, involves the same muscle groups, at a frequency of ?2–3 c/s, and is prolonged. Synonym: rhythmic myoclonus.1.1.2.2.1 JACKSONIAN MARCH?* Noun: Traditional term indicating spread of clonic movements through contiguous body parts unilaterally. 1.1.3  TONIC-CLONIC?* A sequence consisting of a tonic followed by a clonic phase.

Indicates principally distal components, bilateral or unilateral.2. Fumbling, tapping, manipulating movements.1.2.4  GESTURAL?* Often unilateral.* Fumbling or exploratory movements with the hand, directed toward self or environment. * Movements resembling those intended to lend further emotional tone to speech. 1.2.5  HYPERKINETIC?* Involves predominantly proximal limb or axial muscles producing irregular sequential ballistic movements, such as pedaling, pelvic thrusting, thrashing, rocking movements. * Increase in rate of ongoing movements or inappropriately rapid performance of a movement. 1.2.6  HYPOKINETIC * A decrease in amplitude and/or rate or arrest of ongoing motor activity.1.2.7  DYSPHASIC * Impaired communication involving language without dysfunction of relevant primary motor or sensory pathways, manifested as impaired comprehension, anomia, paraphasic errors, or a combination of these.1.2.8  DYSPRAXIC * Inability to perform learned movements spontaneously or on command or imitation despite intact relevant motor and sensory systems and adequate comprehension and cooperation.1.2.9  GELASTIC?* Bursts of laughter or giggling, usually without an appropriate affective tone.1.2.10 DACRYSTIC * Bursts of crying.1.2.11 VOCAL?* Single or repetitive utterances consisting of sounds such as grunts or shrieks.1.2.12 VERBAL?* Single or repetitive utterances consisting of words, phrases, or brief sentences.1.2.13 SPONTANEOUS * Stereotyped, involve only self, virtually independent of environmental influences.1.2.14 INTERACTIVE * Not stereotyped, involve more than self, environmentally influenced.2.0 NON-MOTOR 2.1 AURA?* Noun: A subjective ictal phenomenon that, in a given patient, may precede an observable seizure; if alone, constitutes a sensory seizure.2.2 SENSORY?* A perceptual experience not caused by appropriate stimuli in the external world. Modifies “seizure” or “aura.”2.2.1  ELEMENTARY* A single, unformed phenomenon involving one primary sensory modality (e.g., somatosensory, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, epigastric, or cephalic).?2.2.1.1 SOMATOSENSORY?* Tingling, numbness, electric-shock sensation, pain, sense of movement, or desire to move.2.2.1.2 VISUAL?* Flashing or flickering lights, spots, simple patterns, scotomata, or amaurosis.2.2.1.3 AUDITORY?* Buzzing, drumming sounds or single tones.2.2.1.4 OLFACTORY?* Odor, usually disagreeable.2.2.1.5 GUSTATORY?* Taste sensations including acidic, bitter, salty, sweet, or metallic.2.2.1.6 EPIGASTRIC* Abdominal discomfort including nausea, emptiness, tightness, churning, butterflies, malaise, pain, and hunger; sensation may rise to chest or throat.

(Thus “autonomic aura”; cf. “autonomic events” 3.0).2.2.2  EXPERIENTIAL?* Affective, mnemonic, or composite perceptual phenomena including illusory or composite hallucinatory events; these may appear alone or in combination. Included are feelings of depersonalization. These phenomena have subjective qualities similar to those experienced in life but are recognized by the subject as occurring outside of actual context.2.2.2.1 AFFECTIVE?* Components include fear, depression, joy, and (rarely) anger.2.2.2.2 MNEMONIC?* Components that reflect ictal dysmnesia such as feelings of familiarity (de ?ja`-vu) and unfamiliarity (jamaisvu).2.2.2.3 HALLUCINATORY?* A creation of composite perceptions without corresponding external stimuli involving visual, auditory, somatosensory, olfactory, and/or gustatory phenomena.
